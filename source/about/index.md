# Education

Computer Science undergraduate, sophomore year at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

# Research Interests

Deeply am I interested in the following research areas:

- **Deep Learning**:

    Exploring advanced architectures and techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of neural networks.
    
    Specific interests include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer models.

- **Digital Life**:

    Investigating the intersection of artificial intelligence and digital life, including virtual environments, digital twins, and the impact of AI on everyday life. 
    
    This involves creating realistic simulations and understanding the ethical implications of digital existence.

- **Computational Power Enhancement**:

    Focusing on the optimization and acceleration of computational processes to handle large-scale data and complex models. 
    
    This includes leveraging hardware advancements, parallel computing, and efficient algorithms to maximize computational performance.

</p>

I developed a custom deep learning model called Res-MacNet for CIFAR10 image classification, which integrates residual connections and effective feature extraction strategies to optimize performance.

This model is particularly well-suited for complex image classification tasks due to its deep and intricate network structure, maintaining computational efficiency while capturing detailed feature representations.
