# Welcome to My Blog!

Welcome to my first-ever website and blog post!

Right here, I'm gonna jot down significant milestones in my life, though I'm still figuring out  what those might be.

I've been itching to kick off this blog cuz it's pretty cool, especially for a CS student like me hhh.

However, I've been swamped with all the transfer stuff recently, which kinda put this blog on the back burner.

But at last, here we are.

So...

Let's the journey begin!

## Milestones to be achieved...

This is just the starting!

- **Begin my blog journey**: Sharing my thoughts, ideas, and maybe a few surprises along the way.

- **Achieve new goals**: Preparing for the upcoming final exams and later, the transfer application. Hoping to bring my A-game and receive some dream offers.

Anyway, **Hello World!!!**
