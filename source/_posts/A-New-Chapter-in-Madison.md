# First Time in the U.S. - A New Chapter in Madison

January 16, 2025

This is my first time being in the U.S.

Honestly, it's overwhelming. Everything's new to me.

I felt like a newborn baby facing a new climate, new traffic, new people, and a whole new culture.

## The Weather and People

Not gonna lie, the weather in Madison is cold asf, 

but the people here are warm-hearted.

## New Friends and Experiences

What I've gained the most is meeting a lot of dope brothers.

I hit up Lily's and Mifflin with my homies

Shoutout to RJ and Zane—my first friends in Madison.

Y'all are some *cool cats*.

We hit the bars, played pool, tossed the football—it was so fun.

There's also a group of dudes always up to some *tomfoolery*

—like UFC, KFC ice bucket challenge.

Big shoutout to my boys Big Sami, Rhett, and Abdul

—we're a *colorful* crew.

We vibe out to music I'd never heard before

—Marvin Gaye, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and more.

We talk a lot about culture, language, *milktea*,

and send each other with the dumbest, brain-melting reels ever.

## Learning and Growing

And shoutout to my guy Jake—my slang teacher.

After every MATH240 class, we're both parched and can eat a horse,

so we grab some grub and get stuffed.

Lowkey, sometimes I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place

'cause my English still holds me back in convos—but I know I'm improving.

**Anyway, I f*cking love my TWINS!**
